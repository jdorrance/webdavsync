- Rename file feature that maintains several versions of a file instead of
  overwriting it, up to a configurable depth.
- Optional hidden folder to move files and folders in instead of deleting them.
- Reset option to erase the synchronization history of a directory/URL couple,
  which makes it look like an initial synchronization.

3.6 Changes Since Version 1.0.5

3541353: URI-encoding problem when using the recursion option

Minor changes

  This is for egroupware.

3529671: Exclusions of directories don't work

  response. Zimbra does this. See also

  applied to them, which is not correct.

3478695: Recursive requests do not work with SOGo

Minor changes

- Renaming of files and folders on the server can be detected through etags if
